# Your Adblocker Won't Work Anymore.
## _For most people._

Many extensions or your current browser will have limited funcionality due to Google Chrome's switch to Manifest V3. Google claims that the switch will increase privacy, security, and performance, but I'm sure that they are in it for the $. Google is a for-profit organization, and advertisements make them 100s of billions of dollars every year.

## The Main Problem

Manifest V3 is a change that won't only affect Chrome, but other Chromium _(no, not the element)_ browsers as well. Since Google created Chromium, it has control over lots of the other browsers that use it. The most popular Chromium-based browsers include:
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera (GX)
- Vivaldi

> Note that Firefox wasn't mentioned in the list, because Firefox isn't Chromium-based. This means that they will stick with Manifest V2, and keep all the MV2 extensions working.

Firefox doesn't feel the need to switch so quickly because: 
1. They are non-profit and don't make money off of ads
2. Malicious add-ons/extensions could be fixed in a different way, not disabling certain capabilities

## Now What?
For now, the most obvious and sensible thing to do is to switch to Firefox. Firefox has a very browsing experience to Chrome, and it doesn't have as many bugs as it did 15 years ago. In fact, I made this website in Firefox, and I plan to keep using it. Although removing extensions' abilities in Chrome doesn't sound too bad at the moment, I feel like they are going to continue to do what they want because they are at the top and don't have much competition. This could mark the beginning of a level field between Chrome and Firefox as more and more people switch over.
